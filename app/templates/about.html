                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>For some industries, the Internet has made existing productivity smoother
                    and more efficient, while for others it has actually increased productivity
                    levels (Lancioni et al, 2003). For example, the domain analysis in chapter
                    two examines various software applications which have, themselves, arguably
                    streamlined workflow processes which are otherwise carried out manually by
                    staff. Many similar software systems fall under the banner of Enterprise
                    Resource Planning (ERP), which is commonly used throughout many businesses
                    in many different industries. ERP systems attempt to automate operations
                    from supply-chain management, inventory control and almost any other
                    data-oriented management process (Hitt et al, 2002).</p>
                <p>It has however proven
                    difficult to measure the effect an ERP has on expected returns
                    (i.e. business profit) and whether they eventually materialise remains
                    unknown (Hunton et al, 2003). Nevertheless, studies have offered evidence
                    that the capital market placed incremental value on firms that adopted
                    ERP systems, as investors reacted positively to ERP implementation
                    announcements (Hayes et al, 2001). With regards to firm performance,
                    Poston and Grabski (2001) examined the post implementation process of 50
                    ERP-adopting firms over a threeyear process. Despite mixed outcomes, their
                    results yielded some positive outcomes such as the reduction in the ratio
                    of employees to revenue in each of the three years.
